# Fitting RL models to data

Welcome to Part 2 of the RL tutorial. In this tutorial, we will learn about how to properly fit RL models to data.

This tutorial is basically the pythonic version of BAMB2023 where it was adapted from [Collins and Wilson (2019) eLife](./docs/WilsonCollins2019TenRulesForModelFitting.pdf). The paper is an excellent read and we highly recommend that you go through it in detail in your own time.

Two main python notebooks are provided:
- [`tutorial_2B_RL_instructions.py`](./tutorial_2B_RL_instructions.ipynb) has the instructions, and
- [`tutorial_2B_RL_solutions.py`](./tutorial_2B_RL_solutions.ipynb) has the solutions.
 
Feel free to look at [`models.py`](./models.py), which contains a number of pre-coded functions useful for the tutorial.
